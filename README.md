## Cloud documentation repository
This repository contains few translated examples of my work. These files were approved to share by my previous employer, DevOpsHub. This company specializes in developing and supporting cloud opensource solutions. I made and edited a wide variety of documents there, such as users/administrators guides, technical specifications, product development plans, workbooks for the new employees, presentations and etc.
